# React Test App

This React application was created as part of a hiring test to demonstrate my skills in fetching and manipulating data. The main goals of this project were to test my knowledge in working with HTTP requests, displaying data, and implementing basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Features

- Display a list of cards containing user information.
- Users can click a button on each card to remove it.
- Data is fetched from a JSON server using HTTP requests.
- Date values are converted to Persian (Jalaali) format using the Moment Jalaali library.
- Icons are used for user-friendly interaction, courtesy of the React Icons library.
- The project was created with Vite for a fast development experience.

## Technologies Used

- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Vite: A build tool that enhances the development workflow for React projects.
- JSON Server: A fake REST API server for testing and prototyping.
- Moment Jalaali: A library for handling Jalaali (Persian) dates.
- React Icons: A library for adding icons to React applications.
